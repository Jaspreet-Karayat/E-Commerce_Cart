# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JaspreetKarayat

Welcome to my Web Development Portfolio! This repository showcases my skills and projects as I learn to build websites and web applications.

## ðŸŒŸ Skills

### 1. **HTML**
- I use HTML to structure web pages with elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and forms.

### 2. **CSS**
- I style web pages with CSS to make them look attractive. I use colors, fonts, and layouts to design responsive web pages.

### 3. **JavaScript**
- I use JavaScript to make web pages interactive, like adding click events or updating content without reloading the page.

### 4. **Responsive Design (Media Queries)**
- I use media queries to make sure web pages look good on different devices, like phones, tablets, and computers.

### 5. **Bootstrap**
- I use Bootstrap to quickly build responsive websites with ready-made components like buttons, navigation bars, and forms.

### 6. **React.js**
- I am learning React.js to build dynamic, single-page applications. React helps me manage the content on the page in a more efficient way.

### 6. **Redux Toolkit**
- I am learning Redux Toolkit to efficiently manage the state in my React applications, making complex state interactions simpler and more predictable.
